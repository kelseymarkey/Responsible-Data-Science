# Responsible-Data-Science

These notebooks utilize various metrics and tools (AIF360, LIME) to analyze data and classifiers for issues related to ethics, algorithmic fairness, transparency, privacy, and data protection. These are largely based on assignments completed for the course ["Responsible Data Science"](https://dataresponsibly.github.io/courses/spring20/)  which was developed and taught at the NYU Center for Data Science by Julia Stoyanovich.
